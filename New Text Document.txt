To **add Google Forms to the CTA buttons** or links in your HTML page, you'll need to:

1. **Create your Google Form** (e.g., Webinar Registration, Strategy Call Application).
2. **Copy the form’s link** or **embed code**.
3. **Replace the href in the button's `<a>` tag** with the Google Form link.

### 🔧 Here’s how to do it in your uploaded file:

#### ✅ Example 1: Replace **"🎯 AI Career Roadmap Call – Apply Now"** button

Find this line (around line 400+):

```html
<a href="#contact" class="btn btn-primary">🎯 AI Career Roadmap Call – Apply Now</a>
```

Change it to:

```html
<a href="https://forms.gle/your_form_link_here" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">🎯 AI Career Roadmap Call – Apply Now</a>
```

#### ✅ Example 2: Replace "Join the Next Webinar" CTA

Find:

```html
<a href="mailto:info@growthaiacademy.com?subject=Webinar Registration" class="btn btn-primary" style="margin-top: 1rem;">🎟️ Reserve Seat</a>
```

Replace with:

```html
<a href="https://forms.gle/your_webinar_form_link" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary" style="margin-top: 1rem;">🎟️ Reserve Seat</a>
```

### 🔁 Repeat for other buttons like:

* "📋 Apply Now"
* "📖 View Full Curriculum"
* "📖 Learn More About Kariena"

Replace their `href` values with the respective Google Form links.
